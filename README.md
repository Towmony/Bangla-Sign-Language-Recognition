# Bangla-Sign-Language-Recognition
## Sign-Language-Recognition using MATLAB
___Research projects I did during my undergraduate program___

* Single-Handed Bangla Sign Language Recognition:
  
  The project was an image recognition/classification based project that uses the machine learning techniques KNN, SVM, ANN to recognize Bengali Single Handed Sign Language. It     also incorporated feature extraction techniques namely Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Bag of Features and Line feature.

* ASL Recognition by HOG featues with KNN classifier:
  
  One of my early research project done in my bachelor. This project used KNN classifier and HOG feature extraction technique to recognize American Sign Language.
